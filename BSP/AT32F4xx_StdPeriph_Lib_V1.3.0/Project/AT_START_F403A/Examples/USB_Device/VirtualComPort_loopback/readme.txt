@par Example Description 

  The aim of this example is to read data from and write data to USB devices using the CDC protocol.
  It makes the USB device look like a serial port (NO serial cable connectors:You can see the data
  transferred to and from via USB instead of USB-to-USART bridge connection).
  - OUT transfers: receive the data from the PC to AT32
  - IN transfers: to send the data recived from the AT32 to the PC
