@par Example Description 

  This demo provides a basic communication between USART1 (Synchronous mode) 
  and SPI1 using flags.If received data right ,the Three leds will turn on.
  Notice that if you use EZ to download program, you can't use AT-Link pin to receive
  data, and vice versa.
  
  USART1 configured as follow:
  - BaudRate = 115200 baud  
  - Word Length = 8 Bits
  - One Stop Bit
  - No parity
  - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)
  - Receive and transmit enabled
  - USART Clock enabled
  - USART CPOL: Clock is active high
  - USART CPHA: Data is captured on the second edge 
  - USART LastBit: The clock pulse of the last data bit is output to the SCLK pin

  SPI1 configured as follow:
  - Direction = 2 Lines FullDuplex
  - Mode = Slave Mode
  - DataSize = 8 Bits
  - CPOL = Clock is active high
  - CPHA = Data is captured on the second edge 
  - NSS = NSS Software
  - First Bit = First Bit is the LSB  
  Set-up 
  - Connect USART1_Tx(PA.09) to SPI1_MOSI(PA.07), USART1_Rx(PA.10) to 
    SPI1_MISO(PA.06) and USART1_CK(PA.08) to SPI1_SCK(PA.05).
