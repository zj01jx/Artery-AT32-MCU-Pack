@par Example Desctiption
  This demo is based on the AT-START-F403 board.
  The system enters and exits STOP mode as following:
    The RTC is configured to generate an Alarm event in 3 second then the system enters STOP mode. 
    The  RTC Alarm will wake-up the system within 3 second. After exit from STOP the system clock is reconfigured
    to its previous state (as HSE and PLL are disabled in STOP mode).
    Then after a delay the system will enter again in STOP mode and exit in the way
    described above. This behavior is repeated in an infinite loop.

  Three leds LED2,LED3 and LED4 are used to monitor the system state as following:
    - LED2 on: system in RUN mode
    - LED2 off: system in STOP mode
    - LED4 is toggled if EXTI line17(RTC Alarm) is used to exit from STOP
