@par Example Description
    This demo is based on the AT-START-F413 board,in this demo,PA6 ,PA8 and PB6 output pwm waveform.    
    The Master TMRer TMR1 is running at:
    TMR1 frequency = TMR1 counter clock / (TMR1_Period + 1) = 750 KHz
    and the duty cycle is equal to: TMR1_CCR1/(TMR1_ARR + 1) = 50%

    The TMR3 is running at: 
    (TMR1 frequency)/ ((TMR3 period +1)* (Repetition_Counter+1)) = 49.95 KHz and
    a duty cycle equal to TMR3_CCR1/(TMR3_ARR + 1) = 33.3%

    The TMR4 is running at:
    (TMR1 frequency)/ ((TMR4 period +1)* (Repetition_Counter+1)) = 74.96 KHz and
    a duty cycle equal to TMR4_CCR1/(TMR4_ARR + 1) = 50%
